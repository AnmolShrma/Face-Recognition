This git repo is a small demo for creating a Face recognition application using Kairos face recognition api

There is a single HTMl file in the repo that contains all the required code to create a simple face recognition application

I have used HTML, CSS and Vanila JavaScript for implementing this demo

This project shows the very simple requirement that can be used to start a face recognition project by your own.

There are some things that you will be required to access the Kairos API.

I have attached the link so that you can create your own app_id and app_key for the demo to get start.

[link->] (https://www.kairos.com/docs/getting-started-with-kairos-face-recognition)

Just create the id and the key for the app and place in the code snippet mentioned below.

	 // put your keys in the header
        const headers = {
            "Content-type": "application/json",
            "app_id"          : "YOUR_APP_ID",
            "app_key"         : "YOUR_APP_KEY"
        };

Now copy the path of the index file from your system and paste it on any web browser, That's all you have to do to make it work.

### CODE WITH FUN ###
